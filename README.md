# Python Automation Toolkit
A beginner-friendly collection of Python scripts built to apply introductory computer science concepts through small but complete programs. This repository focuses on automation, problem-solving, and clear program structure rather than production-level software.

## Overview
The repository contains independent Python scripts, each solving a well-defined problem. Together, they demonstrate core ideas such as control flow, functions, input validation, file handling, and basic algorithmic reasoning.

## Modules
### 1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Player vs AI)
- Console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against a simple AI
- Implements board representation, win-condition checking, and turn-based logic
- AI uses rule-based decision making to attempt winning moves, block the player, or choose a random valid move


**Concepts demonstrated:**
- File input/output
- Iterating over structured data
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Use of external Python libraries


**Required input files (inside certificate_generator/ folder):**
- participants.xlsx 
- certificate_template.png

### 3. Password Generator
- Generates random passwords using letters, digits, and selected symbols
- Enforces a minimum password length
- Accepts user input from the command line


**Concepts demonstrated:**
- Strings and string operations
- Randomization
- Functions and loops
- Basic input validation

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Install required libraries for the certificate generator:
pip install pandas pillow qrcode
